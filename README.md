Esoteric is another anti-cheat made for PocketMine-MP. Compared to Mockingbird, this has more checks
I'm deciding to not disclose to the public.
 
## Supported Versions

The versions this anti-cheat currently supports are 1.16.220.

**Protocol List:**
- 431

## Planned Features

- [x] Banwaves - for the memes.
- [x] Discord webhook alerts.
- [x] Commands to edit alert delay, turn on/off alerts, and get player logs.
- [ ] Create a functional exempt list for each detection.

## Detections

These are a list of the current detections Esoteric has, along with descriptions of those checks.

- **Autoclicker**
  - A: Checks if the player's CPS exceeds a certain threshold.
  - B: Checks if the player has duplicated click statistics
- **Aim**
  - A: Checks if the player's headYaw does not correlate with the player's yaw.
  - B: Checks if the player's yaw movement is rounded.
- **KillAura**
  - A: Checks if the player is swinging their arm whilst attacking.
  - B: Checks if the player is hitting too many entities in an instance.
- **Range**
  - A: Checks if the player's range goes beyond a certain threshold.
- **Fly**
  - A: Estimates the next Y movement of the player. This check detects basic flies.
  - B: Checks if the current Y movement of the player is near equal to the Y movement of the player.
  - C: Checks if the user is jumping on the air.
- **Motion**
  - A: Checks for impossible upward motion. If there is no probable way you are able to go up, this check flags.
    Moreover, this also flags HighJump at a certain threshold along with velocity modifiers > 107%.
  - B: Checks if the player is following Minecraft's friction rules in the air. This check can flag Bhop, and
    some flies.
  - C: Checks if the player is following Minecraft's friction rules while on the ground. This check is surprisingly very effective
    and can detect a variety of speeds on the ground. The idea behind this check is that your current speed multiplied by your friction
    cannot be greater than your previous speed.
- **Velocity**
  - A: Checks if the player takes less vertical knockback than normal.
  - B: Checks if the player takes less horizontal knockback than normal. This check is currently unusable.
- **EditionFaker**
  - A: Checks if the player's TitleID does not match the given OS in the Login packet.
- **Packets**
  - A: Checks if the player's pitch goes beyond a certain threshold
  - B: Checks if the player is sending the wrong movement packet too frequently
  - C: Checks if the player is jumping without holding their specified jump button. This also checks if their jump delay is invalid.
- **Nuker**
  - A: Checks if the player is breaking blocks too quickly.
